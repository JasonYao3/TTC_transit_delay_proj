# TTC Bus and Subway Delay Data Analysis: Project Overview
* Performed extensive data analysis on TTC bus and subway delays to see what caused delay and when it happened. 
* Merged and cleaned 46 excels files, over 600k of transit delays from City of Toronto.
* Engineered variablesfeatures from the text of each column.
* Explored datasets to analyze relationships among features (both continuous and categorical).

## Summary of Findings

## Intro
* As a student who went to Ryerson University, I had to commute alot on the TTC buses and subways every week. During my riderships, I had experienced countless numbers of delays on both bus and subway, whether they were long or short delays. Now, I think it would be interesting to dive into the delay data and try to find out interesting insights.

## Data Collection
* I downloaded the data from the City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal https://open.toronto.ca/. There are two sets of data for the two different transportations from January 1, 2014 to May 31, 2020.
* The TTC bus dataset has 7 excel files with 12 excel worksheets for each month from 2014 to 2019 and 5 excel worksheets for each month in 2020.
* The TTC subway dataset has 39 excel files for each month from 2014 to 2020.
* In the dataset, we got the following:
*	Report 
*  Date	
*  Route	
*  Time	
*  Day	
*  Location	
*  Incident	
*  Min Delay	
*  Min Gap	
*  Direction	
*  Vehicle
*  Station	
*  Code	
*  Bound	
*  Line

## Data Cleaning
In the 1.Merge_excel IPython file, I merged the excel files for each transit into two merged excel files.
In the 2.Data cleaning Python file, I needed to clean it up the two merged excel files so that it was usable for our analysis. I made the following changes and created the following variables:

*	Parsed date into year, month and date and time into hour and minute.
*	Removed route numbers that are not bus route numbers
*	Converted time from 12 hour to 24 hour
*  Cleaned up location 
*	Removed rows without delay
*  Made a new column for bus delay at station
*  Removed duplicate columns and fill in NULL values
*  Added a column for different delay type
*  Standardized direction and subway line column

## EDA
In the 3.Bus EDA and 4.Subway EDA IPython files. 
* I looked at the distributions of the continuous variables using seaborn graphs(distplot and boxplot)  the relationships using heatmap and the statistics measure using numpy quantiles function
* I looked at the value counts for the various categorical variables using seaborn barplots and countplots for the Top 20's.
* I used barplots to show the relationship between delays by days of the week and different direction.
* I used wordclouds to show the most frequent words in the location and station columns.
Below are a few highlights from the graphs.

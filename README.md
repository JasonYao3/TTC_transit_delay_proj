# TTC Bus and Subway Delay Data Analysis

## Project Overview
* Performed extensive data analysis on TTC bus and subway delays to see what caused delays, when and where they happened the most. 
* Merged and cleaned 50 excels files of raw data from City of Toronto.
* Engineered variables features from date, time, delay columns to extract features. 
* Explored over 600k records of transit delays to analyze relationships among features (both continuous and categorical).

## Summary of Findings

### Bus
* Most bus delays occured around 6 AM and 3PM. Around 4AM, 5AM and 8PM have the longest delay time.
* Most bus delays are within 2 to 17 minutes long and 10 minutes being the most frequent one with 67630 records.
* 29 dufferin is the bus route that is most frequent to be behind schedule, followed by 52 Lawrence and 32 Eglinton West.
* Number one incident that causes delays is mechanical which takes roughly 10 minutes long, but diversion last the longest, 160 minutes.
* Buses going west are most likely to be behind schedule and they take the longest time.
* Weekdays have more delays than weekends, however, on weekends bus delay are 5 to 10 minutes longer than weekdays.
* 2014-01-07 has 600 bus delays in one day, out of all days from 2014 to 2020, when normally 125 to 230 delays occur in one day.

<a name="Introduction"></a>
## Introduction
As a student who used to go to Ryerson University, I had to commute for hours almost every week on TTC buses and subways. I had experienced countless number of delays on both buses and subways, whether they were long delays (on a shuttle bus) or short delays (random emergence alarm activated). Now that I have graduated, I think it would be interesting to dive into the delay data and try to find interesting insights out of something I used to be so familar with yet overlooked at. 

<a name="Data_Collection"></a>
## Data Collection
I downloaded the raw data from the [City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal](https://open.toronto.ca/). There are two sets of data for two different transportations from January 1, 2014 to August 15, 2020 and October 31, 2020 for bus and subway respectively.
The TTC bus dataset has 7 excel files with 12 excel worksheets for each month from 2014 to 2019 and 8 excel worksheets for each month in 2020.
The TTC subway dataset has 43 excel files for each month from 2014 to 2020.

In the dataset, each row is a record of the delay-causing incident and we have the following information:
*  Report date
*  Route Number (The number of the bus route)
*  Time of the day	
*  Day (Day of the week)
*  Location	/ Station (The location or station of the delay-causing incident)
*  Incident (The description of the delay-causing incident)
*  Delay (in minute)	
*  Gap (in minute)
*  Direction / Bound (where the vehicle heading)
*  Vehicle (vehicle number)
*  Code	(TTC delay code)
*  Line (TTC subway Line)

<a name="Data_Merging"></a>
## Data Merging
In the 1.Merge_excel IPython file, I merged all excel files for each transit into two separate excel files using the following merge excel function.

<details open>
<summary>Show/Hide</summary>
<br>
    
```
# This function merges all excel files and return a dataframe
def merge_excel(transit):
    transit=str(transit)
    path = os.path.abspath('../data/%s'%transit)
    file = os.listdir(path)
    file_list = [os.path.join(path,file) for file in os.listdir(path)]
    df_total = pd.DataFrame()
    for file in file_list:
        excel_file = pd.ExcelFile(file)
        sheets = excel_file.sheet_names
        for sheet in sheets:
            df = excel_file.parse(sheet_name = sheet)
            df_total = df_total.append(df)
    return df_total
```
</details>

<a name="Data_Cleaning"></a>
## Data Cleaning
In the 2.Data cleaning Python file, I needed to clean it up the two merged excel files so that they are usable for our analysis. I made the following changes and created the following variables.

After cleaning:
* the bus dataset has roughly 466000 rows and 18 columns 
* the subway dataset has roughly 133000 rows and 18 columns 

Parsed date into year, month and date and time into hour and minute.

```
bus_df['year'] = bus_df['Report Date'].apply(lambda x: int(x.split('-')[0]))
bus_df['month'] = bus_df['Report Date'].apply(lambda x: int(x.split('-')[1]))
bus_df['day'] = bus_df['Report Date'].apply(lambda x: int(x.split('-')[2]))
```

Removed route numbers that are not bus route numbers. According to [TTC ROUTES IN NUMERICAL ORDER: ALL TIME LISTING](https://transittoronto.ca/bus/8108.shtml)

```
bus_df = bus_df[~((bus_df['Route'] >= 600) & (bus_df['Route'] <900))]
bus_df = bus_df.loc[(bus_df['Route'] >= 5) & (bus_df['Route'] <= 999)]
```

Converted time from 12 hour to 24 hour.

```
def convert_to_24hour(col):
    in_time = datetime.strptime(col,'%I:%M:%S %p')
    out_time = datetime.strftime(in_time, "%H")
    return out_time
bus_df['hour'] = bus_df['Time'].apply(convert_to_24hour)
```

Cleaned up location and station.

```
bus_df['Location'] = bus_df['Location'].str.upper().str.replace(rf'[{punctuation}]', '')
bus_df['Location'] = bus_df['Location'].replace(to_replace='STC', value='SCARBOROUGH TOWN CENTRE')
bus_df['Location'] = bus_df['Location'].replace(to_replace='STN', value='STATION',regex=True)
```

Removed empty delay rows.

```
bus_df = bus_df[bus_df['Min Delay'].notna()]
```

Made a new column for whether transit delayed at station or not
 
```
bus_df['at_station'] = bus_df['Location'].apply(lambda x: 1 if 'STATION' in str(x) else 0)
```

Removed duplicate columns and fill in NULL values for delay and gap columns.

```
bus_df['Min Delay'].fillna(bus_df[' Min Delay'], inplace=True)
bus_df['Min Delay'].fillna(bus_df['Delay'], inplace=True)
bus_df['Min Gap'].fillna(bus_df['Gap'], inplace=True)
bus_df.drop(columns=[' Min Delay', 'Delay','Gap'], inplace=True)
```

Added a new column to categorize different delay type by how long it is.

<details open>
<summary>Show/Hide</summary>
<br>
    
```
def delay_type(col):
    if col >= 1 and col <= 10:
        return 'short'
    elif col > 10 and col <= 30:
        return 'medium'
    elif col > 30:
        return 'long'
 bus_df['delay_type'] = bus_df['Min Delay'].apply(delay_type)
```
</details>
Standardized transits direction and subway line column.

<details open>
<summary>Show/Hide</summary>
<br>
    
```
def direction_simplifier(direction):
    # convert all lowercase characters to uppercase, replace punctuations with empty space and remove leading and the trailing spaces.
    direction = str(direction).upper().replace(rf'[{punctuation}]', '').strip()
    if 'NB' in direction or 'NORTH' in direction or 'N\B' in direction or 'N' in direction:
        return 'N'
    elif 'SB' in direction or 'SOUTH' in direction or 'S\B' in direction or 'S' in direction:
        return 'S'
    elif 'EB' in direction or 'EAST' in direction or 'E\B' in direction or 'E' in direction:
        return 'E'
    elif 'WB' in direction or 'WEST' in direction or 'W\B' in direction or 'W' in direction:
        return 'W'
    elif 'BW' in direction or 'BWS' in direction or 'BOTH WAYS' in direction or 'BOTHWAY' in direction or 'BWAYS' in direction or 'B' in direction:
        return 'B'
    else:
        'NaN'
bus_df['direction_simp'] = bus_df['Direction'].apply(direction_simplifier)
```
</details>

<a name="EDA"></a>
## EDA
In the 3.Bus EDA and 4.Subway EDA IPython files. 
* Only 32% of the subway dataset is the actual delay, which means the delay time is at least 1 minute.
* 5% of the bus dataset recorded did not cause any delay.
-  I looked at the distributions of the continuous variables using seaborn graphs(distplot and boxplot)

<h5 align="center"> Distribution plot and box plot of delay for bus and subway ( Bus (Left) and Subway (Right) )</h5>
<table><tr><td><img src='https://github.com/JasonYao3/TTC_transit_delay_proj/blob/master/pictures/bus_delay_min_dist.jpg' width=500></td><td><img src='https://github.com/JasonYao3/TTC_transit_delay_proj/blob/master/pictures/subway_delay_min_dist.jpg' width=500></td></tr></table>

- Both graphs have many outliers.
- The bus graph on the left has 437747 outliers and 10 minutes delay has 67630 records.
- The subway graph on the right has 41561 outliers and 3 minute delay has 14333 records.
    
```
# initialize continuous variables
bus_cont = actual_delay[['route_num','vehicle','year','month','day','hour','min','delay_min','gap_min']]
# Using a for loop to plot each continous variables and compute quantiles.
for col in bus_cont.columns:
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(12,5))
    cont_num = bus_cont[col].value_counts()
    chart = sns.distplot(cont_num, ax=ax[0], color="orangered", kde=True)
    ax[0].set_title("Graph for %s: total categories = %d" %(col, len(cont_num)))
    sns.boxplot(cont_num, ax=ax[1], color="orangered")
    plt.show()

    compute_quantiles(cont_num)
    print('\n')
```

- check correlations between continuous variables using heatmap

<img src='https://github.com/JasonYao3/TTC_transit_delay_proj/blob/master/pictures/bus_heatmap.jpg' width=500>

```
# check correlations between continuous variables
cmap = sns.diverging_palette(660, 600, as_cmap=True)
sns.heatmap(bus_cont.corr(), vmax=.3, center=0, cmap=cmap, square=True, linewidths=.5, cbar_kws={"shrink": .5})
```

- Calculate quantiles, Interquartile range and outliers using numpy quantiles function

```
# a function to find quantiles, or where most data are.
def compute_quantiles(col_counts):
    Q1 =  np.quantile(col_counts, 0.25)
    Q3 =  np.quantile(col_counts, 0.75)
    IQR = Q3 - Q1
    print('Most data are within %d to %d.'%(Q1,Q3))
    print('Median is', np.quantile(col_counts, 0.5))
    print('The data are usually below %d.'%np.quantile(col_counts, 0.95))
    
    lower_fence = Q1 - 1.5 * (IQR)
    upper_fence = Q3  + 1.5 * (IQR)
    outlier = col_counts[col_counts < lower_fence].sum() + col_counts[col_counts > upper_fence].sum()
    print('Anything above %d and below %d is an outlier.'%(upper_fence,lower_fence))
    print("There are %d outliers." %outlier)
    print('Maximum occurence is %d of %s.' %(col_counts.max(), col_counts.index[0]))
compute_quantiles(bus_date_counts)
```

- I looked at the value counts for the various categorical variables using seaborn barplots and countplots for top code, subway station, bus location and bus route.

<h5 align="center"> Bar graphs for bus and subway delay by hour of the day ( Bus (Left) and Subway (Right) )</h5>
<table><tr><td><img src='https://github.com/JasonYao3/TTC_transit_delay_proj/blob/master/pictures/bus_hour_bargraph.jpg' width=500></td><td><img src='https://github.com/JasonYao3/TTC_transit_delay_proj/blob/master/pictures/subway_hour_bargraph.jpg' width=500></td></tr></table>
    
```
# dataframe for categorical variables
bus_cat = actual_delay[['year','month','day','hour','day_of_week', 'incident', 'at_station', 'direction_simp', 'delay_type']]

# Using a for loop to plot each categorical variable.
for col in bus_cat.columns:
    plt.figure(figsize=(12,5))
    cat_num = bus_cat[col].value_counts()
    print("Graph for %s: total categories = %d" %(col, len(cat_num)))
    chart = sns.barplot(x=cat_num.index, y=cat_num,color="lightseagreen")
    chart.set_xticklabels(chart.get_xticklabels(), rotation=20, horizontalalignment='right')
    plt.ylabel("")
    plt.xlabel(col)
    plt.title("Graph for %s" %(col))
    plt.show()
```

- Use barplots to show the relationship between delays vs day of the week, incident, hour, direction, subway lines.

<h5 align="center"> Delays by Days of the Week and Subway Lines (Bus Direction) ( Bus Direction(Left) and Subway Lines (Right) )</h5>
<table><tr><td><img src='https://github.com/JasonYao3/TTC_transit_delay_proj/blob/master/pictures/Delays%20vs%20Days%20of%20the%20Week%20and%20Direction%20for%20bus.JPG' width=500></td><td><img src='https://github.com/JasonYao3/TTC_transit_delay_proj/blob/master/pictures/Delays%20by%20Days%20of%20the%20Week%20and%20Subway%20Lines.JPG' width=500></td></tr></table>

```
plt.figure(figsize=(12,5));
sns.barplot(x='day_of_week', y='delay_min', data= actual_delay, ci=None);
plt.title("Delays vs Day of the Week");
plt.xlabel("Days of the Week");
plt.ylabel("Delay in minute");
```

- Use wordclouds to show the most frequent bus location and subway station.

<h5 align="center"> Wordcloud to visualize most frequent location and station ( Bus Location (Left) and Subway Station (Right) )</h5>
<table><tr><td><img src='https://github.com/JasonYao3/TTC_transit_delay_proj/blob/master/pictures/bus_location_wordcloud.jpg' width=500></td><td><img src='https://github.com/JasonYao3/TTC_transit_delay_proj/blob/master/pictures/subway_station_wordcloud.jpg' width=500></td></tr></table>

```
words = " ".join(bus_df_notna['location'])

def punctuation_stop(text):
    """remove punctuation and stop words"""
    filtered = []
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    word_tokens = word_tokenize(text)
    for w in word_tokens:
        if w not in stop_words and w.isalpha():
            filtered.append(w.lower())
    return filtered


words_filtered = punctuation_stop(words)

text = " ".join([ele for ele in words_filtered]) 

wc= WordCloud(background_color="white", random_state=1,stopwords=STOPWORDS, max_words = 2000, width =1500, height = 800)
wc.generate(text)

plt.figure(figsize=[10,10])
plt.imshow(wc, interpolation="bilinear")
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```
